# Australia_COVID-19_Analysis

The data for this practice comes from (https://covidlive.com.au/) to analyse and visualize COVID-19 case data and related information (specifically including development and distribution, vaccination status and its relationship to cases, hospitalizations and its relationship to cases) analysis results help explain the distribution of COVID-19 cases in the three or more states above

**download.R** is used to crawl data from the website. If you need to get more state information, you can directly change or add the abbreviation of the state at the end of the link.

**analysis.R** is used to analyze and statically visualize the crawled data

**app.R** implements interactive visualization charts based on the shiny package (including controlling time intervals and weeks)
